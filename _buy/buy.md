Find approved products and services for Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) implementations, and helpful links for purchasing these items using GSA Schedules.

Other current and planned products and services can be found on the [GSA ICAM Solutions Catalog and GSA ICAM Roadmap](../buy/icamsolutions/).

# Products

The FICAM testing program – also known as the [Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201) Evaluation Program](../fips201/) – tests commercial products used in Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentialing systems, physical access control systems (PACS), and public key infrastructures (PKI). These products have been tested and approved to ensure you’re buying products that provide value, and work well together.

The **Approved Products List (APL)** contains the official list of these tested products. There are currently two approved product cagtegories:

1. [PIV Cards](../approved-products-list-piv/)
2. [Physical Access Control Systems](../approved-products-list-pacs-products/)

**I can't find a category or product?**
1. Products and services that have lost their certification due to security concerns are placed on the [Removed Products List (RPL)](../buy/removed-products-list/). 
2. Categories are deprecated after it has reached a level of broad adoption or maturity and further testing is no longer needed (for example, card readers for logical access). Deprecated categories are [shared as a FIPS 201 Program announcement](../sell/fipsannouncements). A deprecated category is not the same as a removed product.

[Contact us](../contact-us/) if you’re unsure if a product is fit for government use.
